# Mentoring 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning
---

Mentoring Session - Job Preparation Program - Pacmann AI

## Instructions
---

1. Please fill all the given tasks in here
2. You can use any library
3. For modeling, please use `sklearn` library
4. You are taksed to create a function based machine learning model. (If you cannot create the functions from the start, you can create without a function first, then put it all into a function)
5. Make sure you are following all the function descriptions
6. **THIS DATA IS SCRAPED FROM LAMUDI**. YOU ARE **PROHIBITED** TO USE THIS DATA OUTSIDE PACMANN MENTORING.
6. Submit your result to the submission form

## Dataset Description

*Note**

- This dataset is scraped from [Lamudi](https://www.lamudi.co.id/)
- We perform several edit for this mentoring purposes. So, please use the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109ZcOSllPPWCETc01tXiI3Fx8BWRU-32/view?usp=sharing).

**Description**
- We're looking to predict the rent price of a house
- The dataset contains of the following fields

<center>

|Feature|Type|Descriptions|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`name`|`str`|The name (title) of a house|
|`url`|`str`|The house url|
|`bedrooms`|`int`|The number of bedrooms|
|`bathrooms`|`int`|The number of bathrooms|
|`floors`|`int`|The number of floors|
|`land_area`|`float`|The area of land in m2|
|`building_area`|`float`|The building area in m2|
|`longitude`|`float`|The house longitude coordinate in degree|
|`latitude`|`float`|The house latitude coordinate in degree|
| `price` | `int` | The yearly rent price (IDR) , (**our target**)|

## Modeling Workflow
---

```
1. Import data to Python
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Training a Machine Learning Models
4. Test Prediction
5. Lets Explore
```
